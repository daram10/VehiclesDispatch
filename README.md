This project focuses on analyzing the intercity trips made by transport fleets to and from the various transportation terminals in Colombian cities, using data provided by Open Data Colombia. The primary objectives are to perform a descriptive analysis that provides insights into the number of passengers per city, the cities that receive the most passengers, the most frequently used routes, and the seasons with the highest passenger flow and number of trips, from 2018 to 2024.			

The data integration process will be carried out using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) methodology, which involves:
Extraction: Collecting relevant data from Open Data Colombia.
Transformation: Cleaning, sorting, and organizing the data for analysis.
Loading: Importing the processed data into a suitable database or analysis tool for further study.
